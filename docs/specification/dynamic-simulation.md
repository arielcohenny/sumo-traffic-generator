## Traffic Control Methods

### Tree Method (Decentralized Bottleneck Prioritization Algorithm)

**Algorithm Overview:**

- **Research Foundation**: Decentralized traffic control strategy based on congestion tree identification and cost calculation
- **Core Principle**: Addresses conflicting traffic flows that compete on opposing cycle times during specific phases at traffic intersections
- **Methodology**: Identifies and prioritizes congestion bottlenecks based on their global network influence rather than local impact
- **Decision Making**: Each intersection makes decentralized decisions using tree-shaped congestion analysis
- **Optimization Goal**: Minimize overall network congestion by prioritizing bottlenecks with highest global cost

**Theoretical Foundation:**

**Multi-Stage Tree Method Process:**

**Stage I - Network Representation and Pre-calculations:**

- **Network Transformation**: Divides street segments into body links (main road segments between intersections) and head links (final approach lanes leading into intersections)
- **Body Links**: Represent continuous traffic flow approaching junctions, capturing traffic buildup over time and critical for identifying congestion patterns
- **Head Links**: Shorter segments where vehicles queue before entering intersections, crucial for determining green time allocation
- **Network Graph**: Transforms urban area into network where nodes represent intersections/lane mergers and links represent street segments

**Stage II - Link Properties Pre-calculation:**

- **Traffic Parameters**: Establishes number of lanes and maximum travel speed (vf) for each body link
- **Flow Capacity**: Calculates maximum flow Qmax using fundamental traffic law (q(t) = v(t) \* k(t)) and May's formula
- **May's Equation**: v(t)/vf^(1-m) = 1 - (k(t)/kj)^(l-1) where kj = 150 veh/km, m = 0.8, l = 2.8
- **Maximum Flow Speed**: Derives Vqmax representing speed at which flow is maximized for each link

**Stage III - Real-Time Congestion Assessment:**

- **Cycle-Based Analysis**: Monitors speed on each body link during every traffic light cycle
- **Congestion Criteria**: Link classified as congested if observed speed < Vqmax, flowing if speed â‰¥ Vqmax
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Real-time analysis conducted continuously throughout simulation

**Stage IV - Congestion Tree Formation:**

- **Trunk Identification**: Body links with head links leading to intersection identified as tree trunks (roots)
- **Recursive Construction**: Congestion trees built by adding adjacent congested body links feeding into trunk, continuing until all feeding links are non-congested
- **Tree Membership**: Body links may belong to multiple trees but serve as trunk for only one tree
- **Branch Classification**: All body links in tree classified as branches regardless of role

**Stage V - Tree Cost Calculation:**

- **Delay-Based Costing**: Cost represents additional time required to cross road compared to maximum flow conditions
- **Cost Formula**: C(t) = dij _ (1/v(t) - 1/vqmax) _ (q(t)*N*T)/60
  - dij: link length (km)
  - q(t): current flow on link
  - v(t): current speed on link
  - vqmax: speed under maximum flow conditions
  - N: number of lanes
  - T: traffic light cycle time (minutes)
- **Branch Cost Distribution**: Link cost divided by number of trees containing that link
- **Tree Total Cost**: Sum of all constituent branch costs, measured in vehicle hours (VH)

**Stage VI - Phase Cost Assignment:**

- **Phase-Link Mapping**: Each phase facilitates movement along specific body and head links
- **Cost Distribution**: Congested body link costs evenly distributed among all trees incorporating the link
- **Trunk Assignment**: Tree costs assigned to their respective trunks
- **Weight Calculation**: Head links receive weights (0-1) based on traffic volume handled during last cycle, normalized against other head links on same body link
- **Phase Cost**: Sum of corresponding body link costs multiplied by head link weights

**Stage VII - Dynamic Phase Duration Calculation:**

- **Competitive Allocation**: Fixed cycle length and phase order with dynamic duration distribution
- **Cost-Based Adjustment**: Phase durations for next cycle determined by current cycle performance
- **Proportional Distribution**: Available duration divided among phases according to their respective costs
- **Balancing Mechanism**: Higher cost phases receive proportionally longer durations to address congestion

**Implementation Process:**

- **Network JSON Generation**: Converts SUMO network to JSON format for algorithm processing
- **Tree Structure Loading**: Builds network tree and run configuration using `load_tree()`
- **Graph Construction**: Creates algorithm Graph object with network topology
- **Cycle Time Calculation**: Determines optimal signal cycle timing based on network characteristics

**Runtime Behavior:**

- **Step Frequency**: Updates traffic light states every simulation step
- **Algorithm Execution**: Calls `graph.update_traffic_lights()` with current time and cycle parameters
- **Phase Translation**: Converts algorithm decisions to SUMO traffic light color strings based on cost calculations
- **Signal Application**: Pushes new traffic light states to SUMO via TraCI

**Key Advantages:**

- **Global Optimization**: Prioritizes traffic flows based on global network cost rather than local impact
- **Real-Time Adaptability**: Analytical simplicity enables swift real-time adjustments in each cycle
- **Decentralized Operation**: Each intersection operates independently while considering network-wide effects
- **Bottleneck Focus**: Accurately identifies root causes of traffic congestion and upstream impacts
- **Fixed Cycle Benefits**: Maintains predictable phase ordering to avoid driver confusion while optimizing durations

**Setup Requirements:**

- **Objects**: `Network`, `Graph`, cycle time calculation
- **Validation**: Runtime verification of algorithm behavior at configured frequency
