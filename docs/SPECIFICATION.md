# SUMO Traffic Generator Specification

This document provides the formal specification for the SUMO Traffic Generator, detailing all available CLI arguments and the 9-step pipeline execution process.

## Project Overview

The SUMO Traffic Generator is a sophisticated Python-based framework that creates dynamic traffic simulations with intelligent signal control. It supports both synthetic orthogonal grid networks and real-world OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, applies configurable lane assignments, and uses Tree Method's decentralized traffic control algorithm for dynamic signal optimization. The system seamlessly integrates with Manhattan street networks and other real urban topologies.
