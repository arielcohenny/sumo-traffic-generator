## 2. Introduction & Research Context

### 2.1 Research Proposal Context

Urban traffic congestion represents one of the most pressing challenges in modern cities, with traditional traffic management systems struggling to optimize traffic flow at the network level. The research proposal "Developing an urban traffic simulation model, based on the identification of traffic bottlenecks in real time" outlined a comprehensive approach to address this challenge through the development of an agent-based simulation model integrated with adaptive traffic control systems.

The proposal identified nine distinct tasks (T1-T9) within a two-stage research plan. Stage 1 focused on developing a minimal spatial agent-based model, while Stage 2 concentrated on studying different strategies to improve urban congestion. Tasks T4-T7, which form the focus of this implementation, represent the technical components required to create an operational traffic simulation framework.

### 2.2 T4-T7 Objectives from Research Proposal

**T4 (Vehicles)** aimed to develop different types of vehicles that move in the simulation and mechanisms that control their route choice decisions. The proposal specified implementing shortest, fastest, and cheapest routing strategies, along with developing ownership types including private vehicles and public transportation. The task encompassed both predefined route vehicles (such as buses) and demand-responsive public transportation vehicles that adapt their routes based on trip demand.

**T5 (Network Analysis)** focused on converting urban infrastructures into topological representations of networks. The objective was to create networks where nodes represent junctions and links represent street segments between junctions, with direction and weight as dynamic parameters representing traffic flow on each link at every time iteration. This task required establishing the foundational data structures for real-time traffic analysis.

**T6 (Traffic Bottlenecks)** involved implementing traffic bottleneck identification and evaluation methodology within the simulation model. The goal was to enable near real-time evaluation and prioritization of congestion bottlenecks in the system. This algorithm was designed to support the adaptive traffic light control system described in T7.

**T7 (Adaptive Traffic Lights Control System - ATLCS)** required configuring the mechanism of adaptive traffic light control to account for identification of traffic bottlenecks. The system needed to identify traffic bottlenecks with high probability of becoming major traffic jams and prioritize these roads for longer green-light durations to improve global traffic flow. Additionally, the task included implementing dynamic road pricing mechanisms to examine how integration of demand reduction and supply increase affects global urban flow.

### 2.3 Project Scope: Synthetic Urban Grid Simulation

This implementation focuses specifically on synthetic urban grid networks, utilizing Manhattan-style orthogonal grid topologies to provide controlled testing environments for the T4-T7 implementations. The choice of synthetic grids offers several advantages: consistent network topology for reproducible experiments, elimination of real-world data complexities that could obscure algorithm performance, and ability to systematically vary network parameters to test system robustness.

The synthetic approach enables comprehensive validation of the Tree Method algorithm under controlled conditions while maintaining the complexity necessary to evaluate traffic control strategies. Grid networks provide sufficient intersection density and route diversity to test multi-vehicle routing strategies while remaining computationally manageable for extensive experimental validation.

### 2.4 Tree Method Algorithm Background

The Tree Method algorithm, referenced in the research proposal as the "JT Method" (Jam Tree Method), represents a decentralized approach to traffic bottleneck identification and prioritization. The algorithm addresses conflicting traffic flows that compete for opposing cycle times during traffic light phases by identifying congestion trees formed by connected street segments experiencing delays.

The method constructs dynamic clusters of congested segments, where the segment congested for the longest continuous time becomes the "trunk" of the congestion tree, with connected segments forming "branches" if they become congested within a predefined time threshold. Each congestion tree is assigned a cost measured in vehicle-hours (VH), calculated by comparing actual travel times to free-flow conditions, multiplied by the number of affected vehicles.

Unlike traditional centralized systems that optimize individual intersections, the Tree Method operates on a decentralized principle where each intersection makes decisions based on local traffic conditions and bottleneck priorities. This approach enables real-time adaptation to changing traffic patterns while maintaining computational efficiency for practical deployment.

## 3. Core T4-T7 Implementation

### 3.1 T4: Vehicle System Implementation

The T4 implementation addresses the research proposal's requirements for diverse vehicle types and sophisticated routing mechanisms. The system implements a 3-type vehicle classification with percentage-based distribution and a 4-strategy routing framework supporting both static and dynamic route computation.

#### 3.1.1 Three-Type Vehicle Classification System

The vehicle system implements three distinct categories with specific physical and behavioral characteristics:

```python
# src/config.py - Vehicle type definitions
vehicle_types: dict = {
    "passenger":   {"length": 5.0,  "maxSpeed": 13.9, "accel": 2.6, "decel": 4.5, "sigma": 0.5},
    "commercial": {"length": 12.0, "maxSpeed": 10.0, "accel": 1.3, "decel": 3.5, "sigma": 0.5},
    "public":     {"length": 10.0, "maxSpeed": 11.1, "accel": 1.8, "decel": 4.0, "sigma": 0.5},
}
```

**Passenger vehicles** represent private cars with higher acceleration (2.6 m/s²) and maximum speeds (13.9 m/s) suitable for urban environments. **Commercial vehicles** simulate trucks and delivery vehicles with longer lengths (12.0m), reduced acceleration (1.3 m/s²), and lower maximum speeds (10.0 m/s) reflecting real-world constraints. **Public vehicles** represent buses with intermediate characteristics (10.0m length, 11.1 m/s max speed) designed for frequent stops and passenger loading.

The system validates percentage distributions through CLI parsing functions that ensure values sum to 100% and reject invalid vehicle types.

#### 3.1.2 Four-Strategy Routing System

The routing system implements four distinct strategies addressing different navigation behaviors. Each strategy follows the Strategy design pattern:

```python
# src/traffic/routing.py - Abstract routing strategy
class RoutingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def compute_route(self, start_edge: str, end_edge: str) -> List[str]:
        pass
```

**Shortest Path Strategy** provides static route computation using SUMO's Dijkstra algorithm, optimizing for distance minimization. **Realtime Routing Strategy** mimics GPS navigation applications with dynamic rerouting at 30-second intervals. **Fastest Routing Strategy** optimizes for travel time rather than distance, with 45-second rerouting intervals. **Attractiveness Routing Strategy** implements multi-criteria optimization balancing path efficiency with destination attractiveness.

The routing mix manager coordinates strategy assignment based on user-specified percentages:

```python
# Strategy assignment example
def assign_strategy_to_vehicle(self, vehicle_id: str, rng: random.Random) -> str:
    strategy_names = list(self.strategy_percentages.keys())
    weights = list(self.strategy_percentages.values())
    chosen_strategy = rng.choices(strategy_names, weights=weights, k=1)[0]
    return chosen_strategy
```

#### 3.1.3 Dynamic Rerouting via TraCI Integration

The system integrates with SUMO's TraCI interface to enable real-time route updates for dynamic strategies. The implementation tracks vehicles using realtime and fastest strategies, triggering route recalculation at their respective intervals:

```python
# From src/sumo_integration/sumo_controller.py
def handle_dynamic_rerouting(self, current_time: float):
    """Handle dynamic rerouting for vehicles with real-time strategies."""
    vehicle_ids = traci.vehicle.getIDList()

    for veh_id in vehicle_ids:
        strategy = self.vehicle_strategies.get(veh_id)
        if strategy in self.strategy_intervals:  # realtime/fastest strategies
            next_reroute_time = self.vehicle_rerouting_times.get(veh_id, 0)
            if current_time >= next_reroute_time:
                # Reroute vehicle based on current traffic conditions
                interval = self.strategy_intervals[strategy]  # 30s or 45s
                self.vehicle_rerouting_times[veh_id] = current_time + interval
```

The routing coordination system manages the complexity of multiple rerouting intervals (30 seconds for realtime, 45 seconds for fastest) and ensures consistent vehicle behavior across different strategies. Dynamic strategies query current traffic conditions and compute updated routes based on travel time estimates, while static strategies maintain their original routes throughout the simulation.

#### 3.1.4 Vehicle Distribution Validation and Performance

The implementation includes validation mechanisms ensuring system consistency and proper vehicle distribution. The validation system checks percentage totals, verifies vehicle type definitions contain required attributes (length, maxSpeed, acceleration, deceleration, sigma), and validates routing strategy configurations.

Performance characteristics vary by vehicle type, with passenger vehicles achieving higher speeds and more aggressive acceleration profiles, while commercial vehicles exhibit more conservative behavior patterns. The system maintains consistent vehicle assignment through deterministic random number generation, ensuring reproducible experiments across multiple simulation runs.

The T4 implementation addresses the research proposal's vehicle system requirements while providing enhanced functionality through sophisticated routing strategies and validation mechanisms. The modular design enables flexible vehicle distribution testing and supports experimental framework needs for reproducible traffic generation across multiple simulation scenarios.

#### 3.1.5 Advanced Departure Pattern System

The vehicle system implements a 6-period departure pattern system that replaces sequential departure (0, 1, 2, 3...) with realistic temporal distribution. The system provides configurable departure patterns including six_periods, uniform distribution, custom rush_hours, and granular hourly control.

The system automatically scales to simulation end_time (default 24 hours) and maintains compatibility with all routing strategies and vehicle types.

### 3.2 T5: Network Analysis Implementation

The T5 implementation establishes the foundational network analysis capabilities required by the research proposal. The system converts urban infrastructure into dynamic weighted networks where nodes represent junctions and links represent street segments, with real-time traffic flow parameters enabling comprehensive network-level analysis.

#### 3.2.1 Topological Network Representation for Synthetic Grids

The network analysis begins with synthetic Manhattan-style orthogonal grid generation using SUMO's netgenerate tool. The implementation creates structured grid networks with configurable dimensions and block sizes:

```python
# From src/network/generate_grid.py - Grid network generation
def generate_full_grid_network(dimension, block_size_m, lane_count_arg, traffic_light_strategy="opposites"):
    netgenerate_cmd = [
        "netgenerate", "--grid",
        f"--grid.x-number={dimension}",
        f"--grid.y-number={dimension}",
        f"--grid.x-length={block_size_m}",
        f"--grid.y-length={block_size_m}",
        "--default-junction-type=traffic_light",
        f"--default.junctions.radius={CONFIG.DEFAULT_JUNCTION_RADIUS}",
        "--tls.layout=opposites",
        "-o", CONFIG.network_file
    ]
```

The grid generation process creates the base topological structure that serves as the foundation for all subsequent network analysis. Each grid intersection becomes a junction node, while street segments between intersections become directional edges with capacity for dynamic weight assignment.

#### 3.2.2 Junction-Edge Relationship Modeling

The system implements sophisticated junction-edge relationship modeling through integrated edge splitting with flow-based analysis. The implementation analyzes traffic movement patterns at each junction to determine optimal network structure:

```python
# From src/network/split_edges_with_lanes.py - Movement analysis
def split_edges_with_flow_based_lanes(seed: int, min_lanes: int, max_lanes: int, algorithm: str, block_size_m: int = 200):
    """Integrated edge splitting with flow-based lane assignment.

    1. Analyzes original netgenerate connections to determine movement counts
    2. Splits edges at HEAD_DISTANCE from downstream junction
    3. Assigns lanes using existing algorithms (realistic/random/fixed)
    4. Updates all 4 XML files (.nod/.edg/.con/.tll) maintaining structure
    """
```

The junction-edge modeling process splits each street segment into head and tail sections, enabling fine-grained traffic flow control and analysis. Head segments connect directly to junctions and handle turning movements, while tail segments carry through traffic. This dual-segment approach provides the granular network representation required for effective bottleneck identification.

#### 3.2.3 Dynamic Traffic Flow Parameters and Network Analysis

The network analysis system implements dynamic traffic flow parameters through the Tree Method's network data builder, which converts SUMO network files into structured representations suitable for real-time analysis:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/classes/net_data_builder.py
class NetworkData:
    def __init__(self, file_path_in, file_path_out):
        self.junctions_dict = {}
        self.connections_per_tl = {}
        self.all_connections = {}
        self.tls = {}
        self.edges = {}
        self.heads = {}
```

The dynamic network analysis tracks traffic flow parameters including edge weights based on travel times, junction connectivity patterns, and real-time congestion states. The system maintains these parameters as weighted network links where weights represent current traffic conditions and can be updated during simulation to reflect changing flow dynamics.

#### 3.2.4 Grid-Based Topology Conversion Algorithms

The implementation includes algorithms for converting grid-based topology into analysis-ready network structures. The conversion process handles geometric calculations for junction positioning, bearing angle computations for edge directionality, and connectivity analysis for traffic flow modeling:

```python
# From src/network/split_edges_with_lanes.py - Geometric analysis
def calculate_bearing(start_x: float, start_y: float, end_x: float, end_y: float) -> float:
    """Calculate bearing angle from start point to end point in radians."""
    return math.atan2(end_y - start_y, end_x - start_x)

def normalize_angle_degrees(angle_degrees: float) -> float:
    """Normalize angle to [-180, 180] degree range."""
    while angle_degrees > 180:
        angle_degrees -= 360
    return angle_degrees
```

The topology conversion algorithms ensure that the abstract grid structure translates into realistic traffic network representations with proper geometric relationships. These algorithms support both the traffic simulation requirements and the Tree Method's need for structured network analysis, enabling comprehensive bottleneck identification and traffic flow optimization.

The T5 implementation establishes the network analysis foundation essential for the Tree Method's operation while providing flexible topology representation suitable for various grid configurations and analysis requirements. The modular design supports both static network analysis and dynamic real-time traffic flow monitoring needed for adaptive traffic control systems.

#### 3.2.5 4-Phase Time-Dependent Attractiveness System

The network analysis implements a comprehensive 4-phase temporal system with configurable bimodal traffic patterns featuring morning and evening peaks. The system uses pre-calculated attractiveness profiles for efficient simulation with real-time phase switching during simulation based on start time.

The temporal system supports both full-day (24h) and rush hour analysis with 1:1 time mapping (1 sim second = 1 real second). Five attractiveness methods (poisson, land_use, gravity, iac, hybrid) integrate with the 4-phase system for realistic traffic generation.

Key parameters include `--time_dependent` flag to apply 4-phase time-of-day variations, `--start_time_hour` (0-24 hours) to set real-world simulation start time, and `--attractiveness` parameter to select from the five available methods.

#### 3.2.6 Land Use Zone Generation

The system implements configurable land use zone generation based on "A Simulation Model for Intra-Urban Movements" research paper methodology. The zone extraction uses cellular grid methodology with six research-based land use types: Residential, Mixed, Employment, Public Buildings, Public Open Space, Entertainment/Retail.

The configurable subdivision system allows zone size independent of junction spacing, controlled by `--land_use_block_size_m` parameter (default 25.0m following research paper methodology). The clustering algorithm generates diverse zone types with appropriate colors and attractiveness values for realistic traffic demand calculation.

### 3.3 T6: Traffic Bottleneck Detection

The T6 implementation delivers the core bottleneck identification and evaluation methodology required by the research proposal. The system integrates the existing Tree Method algorithm for near real-time evaluation and prioritization of congestion bottlenecks, providing the foundation for adaptive traffic control decisions.

#### 3.3.1 Tree Method Algorithm Integration and Adaptation

The system integrates the existing Tree Method bottleneck identification algorithm, which operates through congestion tree construction, where connected street segments experiencing traffic delays form tree-shaped clusters. The algorithm identifies trunk segments (bottlenecks) as the links congested for the longest continuous time:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/classes/current_load_tree.py
class CurrentLoadTree:
    def __init__(self, trunk_link_id):
        self.trunk_link_id = trunk_link_id
        self.all_my_branches = {}  # key: link_id, value: LoadTreeBranch
        self.all_my_leafs = []
        self.uniqueKey = str(trunk_link_id)
        self.current_cost = 0
        self.current_trunk_cost = 0
```

The algorithm constructs spatial trees by analyzing connectivity patterns and congestion states. Each tree represents a cluster of congested links, with the trunk serving as the primary bottleneck and branches representing upstream congestion propagation:

```python
# Tree construction through spatial analysis
def add_link_to_spatial_tree(self, branch_to_be_added, links, my_father):
    link_id = branch_to_be_added
    this_branch = LoadTreeBranch(link_id, my_father)
    self.all_my_branches[link_id] = this_branch
    this_branch.map_potential_spatial_sons(links, self.all_my_leafs)
```

#### 3.3.2 Real-time Cost Evaluation System Using Vehicle-Hours (VH)

The cost evaluation system uses the Tree Method's vehicle-hours (VH) methodology by comparing actual travel times to free-flow conditions, multiplied by the number of affected vehicles. The integration adapts cost calculation per link and aggregates across congestion trees:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/classes/link.py
def calc_my_iteration_data(self, iteration, loaded_per_iter):
    current_speed = max(self.calc_iteration_speed[-1], MIN_VELOCITY)
    current_density = self.calc_k_by_u(current_speed)
    self.is_loaded = current_speed < self.q_max_properties.q_max_u

    if self.is_loaded:
        loaded_per_iter[-1].append(self.link_id)
        # Time loss calculation for cost evaluation
        opt_time_h = self.q_max_properties.q_max_dist_in_iter_time / 1000 / self.q_max_properties.q_max_u
        actual_time_h = iteration_distance_meters / 1000 / current_speed
        time_loss_m = (actual_time_h - opt_time_h) * 60
```

The system tracks cost data per iteration for each link, enabling real-time cost updates and historical analysis. Cost calculation considers both individual link performance and aggregate tree-level impact:

```python
# Tree-level cost aggregation
def calc_spatial_cost(self, links, iteration):
    self.current_trunk_cost = links[self.trunk_link_id].iteration_data[iteration].current_cost_minutes
    for link_id in list(self.all_my_branches.keys()):
        self.current_cost += links[link_id].cost_data_per_iter[iteration].current_cost_for_tree
```

#### 3.3.3 Congestion Prioritization Methodology

The Tree Method's prioritization methodology ranks congestion trees based on their cumulative cost and spatial extent. The algorithm provides multiple cost types to enable flexible prioritization strategies:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/enums.py
class CostType(Enum):
    TREE_CURRENT = 'current_cost'
    TREE_CURRENT_DIVIDED = 'current_cost_divided'
    TREE_CUMULATIVE = 'cumulative_cost'
    TREE_CUMULATIVE_DIVIDED = 'cumulative_divided_cost'
```

The prioritization process evaluates each congestion tree's impact on overall network performance, considering both immediate cost and potential for growth. Trees with higher costs receive priority in traffic light control decisions, enabling global optimization rather than purely local intersection management.

Tree branch cost calculation incorporates weighted factors to account for spatial relationships and congestion propagation patterns:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/classes/link.py
class LinkIterationCost:
    def __init__(self, iteration, current_cost, current_weight):
        self.iteration = iteration
        self.current_cost = current_cost
        self.current_weight = current_weight
        self.current_cost_for_tree = round(current_weight * current_cost, 2)
```

#### 3.3.4 Integration with Synthetic Grid Simulation Pipeline

The bottleneck detection system integrates seamlessly with the synthetic grid simulation pipeline through the Tree Method integration layer. The implementation bridges SUMO network data with the Tree Method's internal data structures:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/integration.py
def load_tree(net_file: str, *, cost_type: CostType = CostType.TREE_CURRENT,
              algo_type: AlgoType = AlgoType.BABY_STEPS, sumo_cfg: Optional[str] = None):
    """
    Parse net_file for <tlLogic> entries and build Tree Method data structures
    """
    # Parse the network XML for traffic-light logic
    xml = ET.parse(net_file)
    root = xml.getroot()
    tls_elements = root.findall("tlLogic")
    tls_ids = [tl.get("id") for tl in tls_elements]
```

Our integration system converts SUMO network files into Tree Method-compatible representations, enabling real-time bottleneck analysis during simulation. The integration maintains synchronization between SUMO's traffic state and the Tree Method's congestion tree calculations, ensuring accurate bottleneck identification and cost evaluation.

The pipeline integration supports both real-time bottleneck detection and historical analysis, providing the adaptive traffic control system with current congestion priorities and predictive insights for proactive traffic management. This integration enables the T7 adaptive traffic light control system to make informed decisions based on comprehensive network-wide bottleneck analysis.

The T6 implementation successfully addresses the research proposal's bottleneck detection requirements while providing the real-time analysis capabilities essential for effective adaptive traffic control in synthetic grid environments.

### 3.4 T7: Adaptive Traffic Light Control System

The T7 implementation delivers the adaptive traffic light control system (ATLCS) specified in the research proposal. The system integrates the Tree Method algorithm for real-time bottleneck-based traffic control, providing dynamic signal optimization that responds to congestion patterns rather than predetermined timing schedules.

#### 3.4.1 Tree Method Traffic Control Implementation

The adaptive traffic control system integrates the existing Tree Method algorithm to provide decentralized, bottleneck-aware signal optimization. The implementation establishes a traffic controller factory pattern that enables comparison between different control methodologies:

```python
# From src/orchestration/traffic_controller.py - Controller factory
class TrafficControllerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create(traffic_control: str, args: Any) -> TrafficController:
        if traffic_control == 'tree_method':
            return TreeMethodController(args)
        elif traffic_control == 'actuated':
            return ActuatedController(args)
        elif traffic_control == 'fixed':
            return FixedController(args)
```

The Tree Method controller implements initialization, update, and cleanup phases that coordinate with the simulation pipeline. The initialization process builds the network representation required by the Tree Method algorithm:

```python
# Tree Method controller initialization
def initialize(self) -> None:
    # Build network JSON for Tree Method
    json_file = Path(CONFIG.network_file).with_suffix(".json")
    build_network_json(CONFIG.network_file, json_file)

    # Load Tree Method objects with original configuration parameters
    self.tree_data, self.run_config = load_tree(
        net_file=CONFIG.network_file,
        cost_type=CostType.TREE_CURRENT_DIVIDED,  # Match original: TREE_CURRENT_DIVIDED
        algo_type=AlgoType.BABY_STEPS,           # Match original: BABY_STEPS
        sumo_cfg=CONFIG.config_file
    )

    self.network_data = Network(json_file)
    self.graph = Graph(self.args.end_time)
    self.graph.build(self.network_data.edges_list, self.network_data.junctions_dict)
```

#### 3.4.2 Real-time Phase Switching Based on Bottleneck Detection

The adaptive system performs real-time phase switching by analyzing congestion trees and prioritizing bottlenecks for green time allocation. The update mechanism operates on calculation cycles synchronized with the Tree Method's analysis intervals:

```python
# From src/orchestration/traffic_controller.py - Real-time update logic
def update(self, step: int) -> None:
    # Tree Method: Calculation time check
    is_calc_time = is_calculation_time(step, self.seconds_in_cycle)

    if is_calc_time:
        iteration = calc_iteration_from_step(step, self.seconds_in_cycle)
        if iteration > 0:  # Skip first iteration
            # Perform Tree Method calculations
            ended_iteration = iteration - 1
            this_iter_trees_costs = self.graph.calculate_iteration(
                ended_iteration,
                self.iteration_trees,
                step,
                self.seconds_in_cycle,
                self.run_config.cost_type,
                self.run_config.algo_type
            )
```

The system integrates bottleneck cost calculations with traffic light phase decisions through the Tree Method's native optimization algorithms. Real-time phase switching responds to congestion tree priorities, extending green times for directions serving high-cost bottlenecks while minimizing delays for competing traffic flows.

#### 3.4.3 Comparison Framework with Baseline Methods

The implementation provides comprehensive comparison capabilities between Tree Method adaptive control and established baseline methods. The system supports three control methodologies for experimental validation:

**SUMO Actuated Controller**: Implements gap-based detection using SUMO's built-in actuated traffic light logic. The actuated controller relies on vehicle presence detection and gap analysis to extend green phases when traffic demand exists:

```python
# Actuated controller - uses SUMO native behavior
def initialize(self) -> None:
    # Initialize Graph object for vehicle tracking (same as Tree Method)
    self.graph = Graph(self.args.end_time)

def update(self, step: int) -> None:
    # Vehicle tracking (same as Tree Method)
    if hasattr(self, 'graph') and self.graph:
        self.graph.add_vehicles_to_step()
        self.graph.close_prev_vehicle_step(step)
```

**Fixed-Time Controller**: Provides deterministic phase cycling with predetermined durations. The fixed controller establishes baseline performance by maintaining consistent cycle times without adaptive behavior:

```python
# Fixed controller - deterministic phase cycling
def update(self, step: int) -> None:
    for tl_id, info in self.traffic_lights.items():
        # Calculate which phase should be active
        cycle_position = step % info['total_cycle']

        # Find correct phase based on cycle position
        cumulative_time = 0
        target_phase = 0
        for phase_idx, duration in enumerate(info['durations']):
            if cycle_position < cumulative_time + duration:
                target_phase = phase_idx
                break
            cumulative_time += duration

        # Update phase if needed
        current_phase = traci.trafficlight.getPhase(tl_id)
        if current_phase != target_phase:
            traci.trafficlight.setPhase(tl_id, target_phase)
```

#### 3.4.4 Performance Optimization and Global Traffic Flow Improvement

The Tree Method implementation optimizes global traffic flow through decentralized bottleneck prioritization rather than local intersection optimization. The algorithm constructs congestion trees that represent spatial clusters of delayed traffic, prioritizing signal phases based on tree costs measured in vehicle-hours:

```python
# From src/traffic_control/decentralized_traffic_bottlenecks/classes/graph.py
def calculate_iteration(self, iteration, iteration_trees, step, seconds_in_cycle, cost_type, algo_type):
    self.sum_edges_list(iteration)
    self.loaded_per_iter.append([])
    for link in self.all_links:
        link.calc_my_iteration_data(iteration, self.loaded_per_iter)
    this_iter_trees = IterationTrees(iteration, self.all_links, cost_type)
```

The performance optimization system tracks multiple metrics including completed vehicles, total driving time, and individual travel durations across all control methods. This enables direct comparison of Tree Method performance against baseline approaches:

```python
# Performance tracking (same across all controllers)
if hasattr(self.graph, 'ended_vehicles_count') and self.graph.ended_vehicles_count > 0:
    avg_duration = self.graph.vehicle_total_time / self.graph.ended_vehicles_count
    self.logger.info(f"Vehicles completed: {self.graph.ended_vehicles_count}")
    self.logger.info(f"Average duration: {avg_duration:.2f} steps")
```

The adaptive traffic control system addresses the research proposal's T7 objectives by providing dynamic signal optimization based on real-time bottleneck analysis. The implementation enables experimental validation of the Tree Method's claimed performance improvements while maintaining compatibility with existing traffic simulation frameworks.

#### 3.4.5 Integration with Synthetic Grid Pipeline

The T7 adaptive traffic control system integrates seamlessly with the synthetic grid simulation pipeline through the traffic controller factory and standardized interfaces. The system supports CLI-based method selection, enabling researchers to compare different traffic control approaches under identical network conditions:

```bash
# Example CLI usage for method comparison
env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python -m src.cli --grid_dimension 5 --num_vehicles 800 --end-time 3600 --traffic_control tree_method --seed 42
env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python -m src.cli --grid_dimension 5 --num_vehicles 800 --end-time 3600 --traffic_control actuated --seed 42
env PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 python -m src.cli --grid_dimension 5 --num_vehicles 800 --end-time 3600 --traffic_control fixed --seed 42
```

The T7 implementation successfully delivers the adaptive traffic light control system required by the research proposal, providing bottleneck-aware signal optimization through Tree Method integration while enabling comprehensive performance evaluation against established baseline methods. The system demonstrates the research proposal's vision of prioritizing congested approaches for improved global traffic flow rather than purely local intersection optimization.

## 4. Implementation Architecture

The implementation follows a modular architecture built around a sequential pipeline pattern with clear separation of concerns. The system employs established design patterns and maintains strict validation boundaries to ensure reliability and extensibility.

### 4.1 Pipeline Architecture

The core architecture implements an 8-step sequential pipeline that transforms synthetic grid specifications into dynamic traffic simulations. The pipeline operates through the Template Method pattern with abstract base classes defining the execution framework:

```python
# From src/pipeline/standard_pipeline.py - Pipeline execution steps
class StandardPipeline(BasePipeline):
    def execute(self) -> None:
        # Step 1: Network Generation
        # Step 2: Zone Generation
        # Step 3: Integrated Edge Splitting with Lane Assignment
        # Step 4: Network Rebuild
        # Step 5: Edge Attractiveness Assignment
        # Step 6: Vehicle Route Generation
        # Step 7: SUMO Configuration Generation
        # Step 8: Dynamic Simulation
```

The pipeline architecture provides a systematic approach to synthetic grid network processing, with each step building upon the previous step's output to create comprehensive traffic simulations.

### 4.2 Key Architectural Modules

### 4.3 Design Patterns Implementation

#### 4.3.1 Strategy Pattern

The routing system demonstrates the Strategy pattern with interchangeable algorithms:

```python
# From src/traffic/routing.py - Strategy pattern
class RoutingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def compute_route(self, start_edge: str, end_edge: str) -> List[str]:
        pass
```

Four concrete strategies implement different navigation behaviors: shortest path (static), realtime (30s rerouting), fastest (45s rerouting), and attractiveness-based routing.

#### 4.3.2 Factory Pattern

The traffic controller factory enables method comparison and experimental validation:

```python
# From src/orchestration/traffic_controller.py - Factory pattern
class TrafficControllerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create(traffic_control: str, args: Any) -> TrafficController:
        if traffic_control == 'tree_method':
            return TreeMethodController(args)
        elif traffic_control == 'actuated':
            return ActuatedController(args)
        elif traffic_control == 'fixed':
            return FixedController(args)
```

#### 4.3.3 Template Method Pattern

The pipeline architecture uses Template Method through abstract base classes that define execution structure while allowing specialized implementations.

### 4.4 Configuration System

The system employs a dataclass-based configuration architecture for type safety and documentation:

```python
# From src/config.py - Dataclass configuration
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class _Config:
    # File paths
    output_dir: Path = Path("workspace")
    network_file: Path = f"{network_prefix}.net.xml"

    # Vehicle types with physical characteristics
    vehicle_types: dict = field(default_factory=lambda: {
        "passenger":   {"length": 5.0,  "maxSpeed": 13.9, "accel": 2.6},
        "commercial": {"length": 12.0, "maxSpeed": 10.0, "accel": 1.3},
        "public":     {"length": 10.0, "maxSpeed": 11.1, "accel": 1.8},
    })
```

The configuration system centralizes all parameters while maintaining immutability and type checking. Default values ensure system functionality without extensive configuration while supporting complete customization for research applications.

### 4.5 Validation Architecture

The implementation includes comprehensive validation throughout the pipeline through a dedicated validation module (`src/validate/`):

- **Argument Validation**: CLI parameter validation with domain-specific constraints
- **Network Validation**: Structure and connectivity verification after each network modification step
- **Traffic Validation**: Route and vehicle configuration validation
- **Runtime Validation**: Tree Method integration and simulation state verification

The validation architecture uses custom exception classes and provides detailed error reporting to ensure system reliability and debugging support.

### 4.6 Integration Architecture
