# Discussion Mode Command

When you type `/talk [your question]`, I will automatically prefix your prompt with "This is just a discussion, do not modify any files." to ensure I only provide information and explanations without making any changes to the codebase.

## Usage
```
/talk [your question or topic]
```

## What it does
Transforms:
```
/talk how can I execute The Tree model examples?
```

Into:
```
This is just a discussion, do not modify any files. how can I execute The Tree model examples?
```

## Examples
```
/talk How does the lane assignment algorithm work?
/talk What are the different routing strategies available?
/talk Can you explain the zone color system?
/talk What's the difference between OSM and synthetic networks?
```

Perfect for when you want explanations, discussions, or information without any file modifications.
